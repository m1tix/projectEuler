# projectEuler
Some project Euler solutions in python. Note that every solution works for
the matching hackerrank problem after some optimization. For example, for
problem 12 one needs to store all the triangle numbers with their total number
of divisors to prevent recomputing.

Secondly, we note that some files contain multiple functions: one for the
original project Euler problem and one for the harder hackerrank problem. This
is due to the fact that the problems differ too much to be considered the same function,
e.g. problem 23.


### TODO

- [ ] Possible benchmarking.
- [ ] Problem 19.
