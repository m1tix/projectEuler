# projectEuler
Just some project Euler solutions in python. Note that every solution works for
the matching hackerrank problem after some optimization. For example, for
problem 12 one needs to store all the triangle numbers with their total number
of divisors to prevent recomputing.

### TODO

- [x] Problem 14: the current version does not bode well with the Hackerrank version. Possibly changing the dictionary to a list/tuple?
